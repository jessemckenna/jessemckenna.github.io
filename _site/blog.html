	<h3>Week 2, advanced forensics and data recovery</h3>
	<p class="date">2019-1-22</p>
	<p>This week I learned about the area of computer forensics, which is used when computer data enters into legal proceedings as evidence. Forensics can include live forensics (analysis of the state of a running computer system and the preservation of said state in a legally acceptable format), post-mortem forensics (analysis of stored data), and network forensics.</p>

<p>The most important principles are to minimize data loss, record everything, and maintain impartiality, so as to ensure an analyis is admissible in court. The ideal outcome is the use of <em>triage</em> to support a finding; this term refers to the use of multiple data sources that all point to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>This week was a basic introduction to malware and the field of security: terminology, tools, and usual actors involved.</p>

	<p>This is my first post using Jekyll + Github Pages to generate a blog! I was pleasantly surprised at how little needed to be changed to accomodate this setup.</p>
