				Task management helper app for Google Calendar that gets a list of tasks from the user, then automatically assigns the tasks time slots on the user's Google Calendar based on the amount of available time and the tasks' deadlines. Developed for the OSU Hackathon Club's Spring 2018 Hackathon as a team of four.
			</p>
			<p>
				I contributed app connection to the Google Calendar API (initial task retrieval and final task insertion), working hours for task scheduling, and front-end Material-UI styling. This project gave me a lot of experience reading API and library documentation, and hooking those up with a project.

				Volunteer project developing a web tool for cities to measure their biodiversity and assess strategy.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am volunteering as part of the development team on an ongoing basis. This has been a great opportunity to practice the logistics of development, like how to build and run a project locally, how to set up a Docker container, and best practices for collaboration using Git.

	<h2>Traveling-Salesman Solver</h2>

				A 2-Opt approximation solver for the Traveling Salesman Problem.
			</p>
			<p>
				This was my final project for Algorithms, completed as a team of three. The program had to handle extremely large sets of city coordinates under a time constraint and produce an accurate result, so this project was a fantastic way to put efficient coding into practice and see the incremental benefits in real time.
			</p>
			<p>
				The program begins by finding a greedy starting path, then repeatedly selects two path nodes and checks whether the path length would be improved by swapping them. This swapping process continues until a certain amount of node pairs have been checked in a row with no potential improvement found, or time runs out.
